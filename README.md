# first_simple_ml_pipeline_and_deployment
created a simple twitter sentiment analysis model with pipeline and deployed in localhost that takes latest 50 tweets on given keyword and classify it as hatred  tweet or not
using pipeline created a joblib file and used flask to deploy it 
Not a great ml model since tried to explore only on pipeline and deployment,the data is imbalanced and need to do undersampling or oversampling.
